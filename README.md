# Hey there 👋, I'm Michael.

I'm a pharmacist turned full-stack developer. Currently working as a full-stack developer at Taina Technology Ltd. I'm passionate about programming and software development and want to help others to make the leap into programming as I did, that's why I founded [SimplifyingCode.com](https://simplifyingcode.com). I believe that people are the best resources we have and amazing things can happen when we work together 💪. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn, get new experiences and collaborate with others, please feel free to reach out and connect at any time.
